# NeuralOscillator

An interactive neural sound synthesis environment where artificial neurons generate and modulate audio in real-time, creating emergent musical patterns through their interconnections and spatial relationships.

## Features

- Real-time neural network-based sound synthesis
- Spatial audio processing with 3D positioning
- Dynamic voice allocation and optimization
- Interactive neuron parameter controls
- Multiple audio buses with effects chains
- Optimized oscillator bank system
